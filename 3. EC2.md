# Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) for:

- **Virtual Machines**: Rent EC2 instances
- **Storage**: Use Elastic Block Store (EBS) for data storage
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic with Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
- **Auto Scaling**: Automatically scale with Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)

## Sizing and Configuration Options

- **Operating System (OS)**: Linux, Windows, Mac OS
- **Compute Power**: Choose CPU cores and power
- **Memory (RAM)**: Allocate necessary RAM
- **Storage**:
  - Network-attached: EBS (Elastic Block Store) or EFS (Elastic File System)
  - Instance Store: Physical storage tied to EC2
- **Network**:
  - Network card speed and Public IP address options
- **Security**:
  - Configure firewall rules with Security Groups
- **Bootstrapping**:
  - Use EC2 User Data script to configure at launch

## EC2 User Data Script

A feature that lets you run a root-access script on an EC2 instance's first launch to automate setup tasks like:

- Installing updates
- Installing software
- Downloading files
- Etc.,

## Instance Types

AWS offers EC2 instance types optimised for specific workloads.

### Instance Naming Convention

- **Format**: `m5.2xlarge`
  - `m`: Instance family (e.g., general purpose)
  - `5`: Generation (newer generations improve performance)
  - `2xlarge`: Size within the family

### Types of EC2 Instances

1. **General Purpose**

   - Balanced computer, memory and network for a variety of workloads:

     - Web servers
     - Code repositories
     - Development and test environments

2. **Compute Optimized**

   - High performance for <span title="Process calculations quickly">compute-intensive</span> tasks:
     - Batch processing
     - Media transcoding
     - High-performance web servers
     - High-performance computing (HPC)
     - Scientific modelling & machine learning
     - Dedicated gaming servers
   - Process calculations quickly

3. **Memory Optimized**

   - Enhanced memory capacity for large datasets in real-time:
     - High-performance databases
     - Cache stores
     - Real-time big data processing
     - Business intelligence (BI)
   - RAM / in-memory / temporary storage

4. **Storage Optimized**

   - High disk throughput for data-intensive tasks with significant read/write needs:
     - Online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
     - Data warehousing
     - Large-scale databases
     - Distributed file systems
   - Disk / persistent storage
