# Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) for:

- **Virtual Machines**: Rent EC2 instances
- **Storage**: Use Elastic Block Store (EBS) for data storage
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic with Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
- **Auto Scaling**: Automatically scale with Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)

## Sizing and Configuration Options

- **Operating System (OS)**: Linux, Windows, Mac OS
- **Compute Power**: Choose CPU cores and power
- **Memory (RAM)**: Allocate necessary RAM
- **Storage**:
  - Network-attached: EBS (Elastic Block Store) or EFS (Elastic File System)
  - Instance Store: Physical storage tied to EC2
- **Network**:
  - Network card speed and Public IP address options
- **Security**:
  - Configure firewall rules with Security Groups
- **Bootstrapping**:
  - Use EC2 User Data script to configure at launch

## EC2 User Data Script

A feature that lets you run a root-access script on an EC2 instance's first launch to automate setup tasks like:

- Installing updates
- Installing software
- Downloading files
- Etc.,

## Instance Types

AWS offers EC2 instance types optimised for specific workloads.

### Instance Naming Convention

- **Format**: `m5.2xlarge`
  - `m`: Instance family (e.g., general purpose)
  - `5`: Generation (newer generations improve performance)
  - `2xlarge`: Size within the family

### Types of EC2 Instances

1. **General Purpose**

   - Balanced computer, memory and network for a variety of workloads:

     - Web servers
     - Code repositories
     - Development and test environments

2. **Compute Optimized**

   - High performance for [compute-intensive](#compute-intensive-info) tasks:
     - Batch processing
     - Media transcoding
     - High-performance web servers
     - High-performance computing (HPC)
     - Scientific modelling & machine learning
     - Dedicated gaming servers

3. **Memory Optimized**

   - Enhanced [memory](#memory-info) capacity for large datasets in real-time:
     - High-performance databases
     - Cache stores
     - Real-time big data processing
     - Business intelligence (BI)

4. **Storage Optimized**

   - High [disk](#disk-info) throughput for data-intensive tasks with significant read/write needs:
     - Online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
     - Data warehousing
     - Large-scale databases
     - Distributed file systems

### Example Instances

| Instance      | Type              | vCPU | Mem (GiB) | Storage          | Network Performance | EBS Bandwidth (Mbps) |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ---- | --------- | ---------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| `t2.micro`    | General Purpose   | 1    | 1         | EBS-Only         | Low to Moderate     | -                    |
| `t2.xlarge`   | General Purpose   | 4    | 16        | EBS-Only         | Moderate            | -                    |
| `c5d.4xlarge` | Compute Optimized | 16   | 32        | 1 x 400 NVMe SSD | Up to 10 Gbps       | 4,750                |
| `r5.16xlarge` | Memory Optimized  | 64   | 512       | EBS-Only         | 20 Gbps             | 13,600               |
| `m5.8xlarge`  | General Purpose   | 32   | 128       | EBS-Only         | 10 Gbps             | 6,800                |

## Security Groups in EC2

Security Groups act as a virtual firewall for EC2 instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic.

- **Rules-Based Control**: Rules allow traffic based on IP addresses or other security groups.
- **Allow Rules Only**: Security Groups use only allow rules â€” any traffic not explicitly allowed is automatically denied.
- **Instance-Level Security**: Each EC2 instance in a specific VPC and region can have one or more security groups attached.

### Key Features

- **Firewall Behavior**: Control access to ports and authorised IP ranges (IPv4 and IPv6).
- **Default Traffic Rules**:
  - Inbound: All traffic is blocked by default.
  - Outbound: All traffic is allowed by default.
- **Reusable Across Instances**: One security group can be used across multiple instances.

### Practical Tips

- **Dedicated SSH Security Group**: It's advisable to create a separate group to manage SSH access.
- **Troubleshooting Access Issues**:
  - **Timeouts**: Likely due to a security group blocking traffic.
  - **Connection Refused**: Often indicates an application issue or service that is not running.

### Common Ports to Configure

- **22** - SSH: Linux instance login
- **21** - FTP: File upload to a share
- **22** - SFTP: Secure file transfer over SSH
- **80** - HTTP: Access unsecured websites
- **443** - HTTPS: Access secured websites
- **3389** - RDP: Windows instance login
